First [install QuickOPC
2017.1](http://www.opclabs.com/products/quickopc/downloads). There is
no need to license the library. The test case should succeed even
without a license installed.

Once you have built in VS, run like:

```
"\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TestWindow\vstest.console.exe" VS99907\bin\Debug\VS99907.dll
```
